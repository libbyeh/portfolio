          <h2 className='headline obj-head'>The Objective</h2>
          <p className='details objective-details'>My dad was diagnosed with Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome 5 years ago. 
          Also know as CRPS, it is defined by the constant and severely painful burning in one's limbs, in my dad's case, 
          in his legs & feet. After researching pain relief methods for CRPS, I found that whole body vibrations can significantly help with chronic 
          pain, but that means one would be bed/chair-ridden depending on your level of pain. I wanted to 
          better understand if people that live with severe chronic pain could benefit from new advances in mobile -technology 
          to relieve pain and still lead active lifestyles. However after user interviews were complete, I found people 
          were not looking for more treatment options but rather, connection and understanding. </p>
          <h2 className='headline problem-head'>The New Problem</h2>
          <p className='details problem-details'>People that live with severe chronic pain need a way to connect with 
          people who can relate to them and their pain-adapted lifestyles. It is hard to find support groups 
          specific to their chronic pain type and they would benefit from meeting people who can provide 
          additional support</p>

            <p className='details research-details'>True empathy was key to deeply understanding the problems and 
            realities of those I interviewed. They face extreme difficulties on a day-to-day basis. 
            By keenly listening and appreciating those hardships, I was able to better understand what they 
            really needed beyond their physical needs.</p>

              <p>3. Users have trouble finding support groups or others dealing with the same pain or new friends in general.</p>
              <p>4. Users often choose not to share their pain experiences with loved ones and friends to not burden or worry them. </p>
              <p>5. Users need to stay active, including walking and exercise routines. They often do this alone but are open to doing with a friend.</p>
